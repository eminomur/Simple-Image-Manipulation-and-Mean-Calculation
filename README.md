# Simple-Image-Manipulation-and-Mean-Calculation
This is a C++, Qt and OpenCV program

Button at the bottom of the program is separate from others. With this program you can show resolution of image,
  view image in grayscale and black and white (binary) format, swap intensity values of channels of RGB image and show them
  and finally calculate mean of the selected images and show resulting image. I hope it helps other people.
